{"name":"OracleIRC","tagline":"Oracle IRC bot for #rapid, and usage of the RapidIRC plugin","body":"If you join the IRC channel [#rapid](http://rapidcraftmc.com/chat.php) you will find 3 strange users; Oracle, RapidSurvival and RapidCreative. Oracle is an IRC bot created by me that can be used to take notes, show smileys, and maintain the IRC. RapidSurvival and RapidCreative are 'linking' bots that connect their respective worlds with the IRC.\r\n\r\nTo use these new functions, there's a few simple commands to know which I'll be going through briefly.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nOracle\r\n======\r\nOracle is a bit more interactive and all the commands can be accessed through any of these characters/phrases:\r\n```\r\n    ?[cmd]\r\n    ![cmd]\r\n\tOracle, [cmd]\r\n```\r\nThe Oracle bot has a built in help-guide to allow quick access to any commands required. It uses categories to separate different types of commands. These categories are:\r\n```\r\n    ?help emotes\r\n    ?help server\r\n    ?help personal\r\n    ?help other\r\n```\r\n*Emotes* contains a list of the available emotes and their commands. Please note that this command (`?help emotes`) fails if done in-game due to a bug, and also that many of the symbols used are displayed incorrectly in Minecraft's font.\r\n\r\n*Server* contains commands relating to server events and small, useful tools.\r\n\r\n*Personal* contains access to `?notes` and `?mail` two very useful functions in Oracle.\r\n\r\n*Other* contains silly and maybe useless stuff.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# This user documentation page is a work in progress.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
